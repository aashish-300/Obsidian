1. Ahead Of Time(AOT) vs Just In Time(JIT)
	- AOT precompiles before they are loaded in the browser.
	- JIT compiles angular templates during runtime right in the client's browser
2. Explain what an ngModule is.
   - An NgModule is a class marked by the `@NgModule` decorator. This decorator accepts _metadata_ that tells Angular how to compile component templates and configure dependency injection.
